# Chinese Writing Assessment with LLMs

## Authors: Zexin Xu, Zilu Jiang

This repo includes codes utilizing LLMs (GPT, iFLYTEK and Baidu Cloud) to assess students writing assignment. For privacy concerns, all students data are not included as well as keys for LLMs API calling. If you have questions of setting up an account to those platforms, feel free to send me an email.

## File Explanation

Notebooks in the root folder includes the usage of APIs. Minor modification is needed, such as importing your own dataframe. Inside the notebooks, I have attached the links to official documentations of the APIs. For iFLYTEK and Baidu Cloud, if you are an English user, you can change the language settings of documentation on the top right corner.

`Full_Version` folder includes all codes includes data processing, result analysis and confusion matrix calculation. Those codes are not well organized and may not be easy to read. They were used only for the current study's data. If you need help on how to use them, I would love to help.
